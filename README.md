### Research Experience
**Research Assistant**, **Complex and Sustainable Urban Networks Laboratory**, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL\
August 2021 – Present

•	Impacts of depopulation on infrastructure- buildings and roadways (July 2023–Present)
-	Extracted data from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) database
-	Forecasted residential built-up volume and roadway lane meters for U.S. cities up to 2100
-	Assessed infrastructure burden in terms of per capita quantity change over time

•	Depopulation in Illinois: Understanding and Forecasting Impacts on Transportation (May 2021-June 2023)
- Identified population trends in cities in Illinois
- Developed a survey to identify transportation challenges in depopulating cities in Illinois
- Forecasted population trend for cities in Illinois for five SSPs based on the dataset developed by Hauer (2019) and NCAR data 

•	Investigating Attitudinal and Behavioral Changes in US Households Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Pandemic (October 2020-April 2021) 
- Worked to identify the scope of data imputation on completing the missing values in the survey data. Trying different available data imputation tools around 60% accuracy can be achieved in imputing the data.

### Projects 
•	Impacts of depopulation on infrastructure- buildings and roadways : **Median per capita RL (m/person) vs. median per capita RBUV (m3/person) by city type for each state**

(a) cities with a population ≤ 10,000

<img alt="Fig 1" width="500" height="400" src="Figures/below_10000.gif"/>

(b) cities with a population > 10,000

<img alt="Fig 2" width="500" height="400" src="Figures/above_10000.gif"/>

 
 The darker transparency includes the distribution of 50% of the data points and the lighter transparency includes the distribution of 90% of the data points. Here, each data point represents the median value of per capita infrastructure for cities by state and city type category. With 50 states and 4 city types, each plot shows 200 data points. In this figure, an upward (right) shift indicates that per capita median value increases, thus an increasing burden. Conversely, a downward (left) shift means a lower burden.
